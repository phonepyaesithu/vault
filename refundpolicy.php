            <p>
                Kindly note that the shipping rates outside of the UK are not inclusive of any customs or
                import duties that could be levied when the package reaches your destination country.
                Duties rates vary depending on the value of the goods, what they are made of and where they are made.
                <br><br>
                Importantly, all countries have different rules regarding this so we are unable to tell you exactly what
                duties
                you may be required to pay as this is determined on import by customs officials.
                <br><br>
                You will not always be required to pay duties or import tax, but it is important that you make yourself
                aware of
                the duties and thresholds that may apply in your country in case you are charged to avoid any surprises.
                <br><br>
                We are not held liable for any customs fees in your country, holding times, unclaimed parcels or
                incorrect
                shipping information provided.
                <br><br>
                If you decide not to pay import taxes or duties and choose to reject the parcel,
                you will not be refunded for your order.
